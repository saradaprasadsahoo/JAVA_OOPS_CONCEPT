What is encapdulation in java ?
it is the 4 main oops concept in java along with abstraction and inhertance interface.

Encapsulation mean binding the data and method that operats on that data single unit in a class.
and restricting acess to the data outside of the class.

main idea:-
Encapsulation = Data hiding + data protection.

you can hide the variable useing private access modifier and provide controlled assecc through getters and setters.
 class Student {
    // Step 1: Private data members (data hiding)
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Step 2: Public getter method (read access)
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Step 3: Public setter method (write access)
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        // Example of controlled access
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age must be positive!");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();

        // Access data only through methods
        s.setName("Sarada");
        s.setAge(22);

        System.out.println("Name: " + s.getName());
        System.out.println("Age: " + s.getAge());
    }
}
How to use Encapsulation
Declare variables as private → They can’t be accessed directly from outside.
Use public getter and setter methods → Allow controlled access.
Protects internal data → Prevents accidental or unauthorized modification.

What is encapsulation?
→ Encapsulation is the process of binding data and methods together and restricting direct access to data by making it private.

Why is encapsulation important?
→ It ensures data security, maintainability, and flexibility.

How is encapsulation implemented in Java?
→ Using private variables and public getter/setter methods.

Can we achieve encapsulation without getters and setters?
→ Partially yes (by using private data), but for full encapsulation, you must use getters and setters.

Is encapsulation and data hiding the same?
→ No, data hiding is part of encapsulation; encapsulation also includes bundling of data and behavior.
