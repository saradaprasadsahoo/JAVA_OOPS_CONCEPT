What is abstract in java ?
Abstract is a non-access modifier in java used in 
*class
*method

it is used for hideing the implementation and provide only necesarry implimention for the blue print.
 Abstract class in java :-
         we can create a abstract class useing declare the keyword abstract. we can't create the oject of the abstract class.
 it contain abstract method without body.
 and contain concrete method with body.
and contain constructor , variables and static method or blocks.

example is 
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();  // abstract method

    void sleep() {              // concrete method
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Animal a = new Animal();  //Not allowed
        Animal dog = new Dog();     //  Allowed (polymorphism)
        dog.makeSound();           // Output: Bark!
        dog.sleep();              // Output: Sleeping...
    }
}


ABSTRACT METHOD:-
Abstract method is declard with abstract keyword and the method contain without any implementation mean no body ,it must be implented body in child class.
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();

    void fuel() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle needs fuel.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with a key.");
    }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Bike starts with a button.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v1 = new Car();
        v1.start();   // Car starts with a key.

        Vehicle v2 = new Bike();
        v2.start();   // Bike starts with a button.
    }
}


Why we use abstract class and abstract method :-
we can achive partial abstraction.
it is use in API's and framework
To provide common code to all subclasses

 SOME IMPOTRANT QUESTION IN ABSTRACTION:-

Can abstract class have a constructor?
➤ Yes, it can, but cannot be called directly — only via subclass.

Can abstract class have a main() method?
➤ Yes, it can — but it cannot be instantiated.

Can an abstract method be static or final?
➤ No — it must be overridden.

Can we declare an abstract class without any abstract method?
➤ Yes, possible. It just can’t be instantiated.

Difference between abstract class and interface (Java 8+)?
➤ Interface can now have default and static methods, reducing the gap.

Can we make a method abstract and private?
➤ No — because private methods cannot be overridden.
